# Machine Learning and Portfolio Optimization in the US Stock Market
## Project information
- **Author**: Jiayi Wang, Applied Mathematics, Class of 2024, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the Problem Set 2 for STATS201 Introduction to Machine Learning for Social Science, 2022 Autumn Term (Seven Week - Second) instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgments**: I am deeply indebted to my professor Luyao Zhang for her invaluable patience and feedback. I could not started my journey without her instructions and help. Additionally, this endeavor would not have been possible without Yahoo Finance. I am also grateful to my classmates, especially for Josh's suggestions on my poster. Lastly, I would be remiss in not mentioning my family, especially my parents.
- **Project Summary**: 
AI has already been widely used in deciding investments. However, not many previous studies have considered the transaction cost in the US stock market, which cannot verify its earning ability in the real world. We will find out which combination of the machine learning method and portfolio optimization model will construct a portfolio that has the highest net profit. All the stock data used in this project will come from Yahoo Finance. We aim to find the best machine learning method and optimization model for arbitrage by comparing the performance of different combinations. The project will contribute to the application of machine learning methods in investment, and tell which algorithm can construct a better portfolio based on the prediction results. The study considers trade execution, taking transaction cost into account, and thus it can provide a direction for the improvement of the algorithms in a real-world implementation.
